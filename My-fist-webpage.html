<p> When I decided to come here, I had this feeling that we will be guided through most of this things. Shock on me. Here I am, seated at a corner, machines wailing as I try to make my first day work out. I wasn't able to understand command line but I managed to do a few things. </p>
<p> For me to be at par with everyone, I will need three things: </p>
<ul> Focus.</ul>
<ul> Alot of reading.</ul>
<ul> Alot of Asking and listening to elders.</ul>
<p> It's a wednesday and we are stil figuring out how to work out Git and Git Hub <p>
