<p> When I decided to come here, I had this feeling that we will be guided through most of this things. Shock on me. Here I am, seated at a corner, machines wailing as I try to make my first day work out. I wasn't able to understand command line but I managed to do a few things. </p>
<p> For me to be at par with everyone, I will need three things: </p>
<ul> Focus.</ul>
<ul> Alot of reading.</ul>
<ul> Alot of Asking and listening to elders.</ul>
<p> It's a wednesday and we are stil figuring out how to work out Git and Git Hub <p>
  <p> Figuring out how to keep adding stuff to git hub <p>
  <p> We need to find out how this backing works.<p>
  <p> Going <strong>forward </strong> now. Check out <a href="http://www.moringaschool.com/">Moringa School</a>. It's a great school for learning web programming! This is where <a href="http://www.koamedia.co.ke/"> KoaMedia </a> has taken Oduor Jagero, the Lead to learn about this great coding stuff</p>
  <p> To know what the Lead looks like, you may first understand that he is a badass writer. And you may wanna know how he holds his pen by checking him out here: <img src="https://www.books.magunga.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Oduor-Jagero.jpg" width="100" height="120" alt=Oduor Jagero holding a pen/>
